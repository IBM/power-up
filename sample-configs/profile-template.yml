    help: The BMC VLAN is the VLAN number of the vlan in which the BMC ports
        reside. Power-Up can create a tagged VLAN interface on a physical
        Ethernet interface of this installer node. If using VLANs it is the

        already on the switch ports to which the BMC ports are connected and
        that the switch port to which the installer node is connected is in
        trunk mode with the PXE VLAN allowed.
